# CRS Report - Text-based Analysis
CSR reporting covers a broad and diverse array of disclosures in the areas like labour practises, community activities, company’s social and environmental performance, with a focus to improving relationships with stakeholders by legitimising their actions and taking up responsibility for their actions towards the stakeholders.

CSR has become widely popular in developed countries. Recently, the importance of CSR has also been recognized in developing countries as well. The companies are socially responsible to society since they are part of it.  This approach becomes critical since it is a performance indicator when the stakeholders' interests are considered. Investors consider a company’s environmental and social governance before deciding to invest. Consumers make sure they buy products which are produced responsibly under fair and humane working conditions. CSR reporting enables transparency in such issues by effectively communicating their impacts on sustainable development.   

Among the numerous CSR reporting framework available, GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) is the widely adopted one (used across more than 100 countries). The GRI Standards enable any organization – large or small, private or public – to understand and report on their impacts on the economy, environment and people in a comparable and credible way, thereby increasing transparency on their contribution to sustainable development. In addition to companies, the Standards are highly relevant to many stakeholders - including investors, policymakers, capital markets, and civil society. The GRI Standards are regularly reviewed to ensure they reflect global best practices for sustainability reporting, helping organizations respond to emerging information demands from stakeholders and regulators. 

## Aim 
The aim of our research was to analyse CSR reporting trends in the energy sector on key issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, diversity, employee health, and consumer welfare. We chose to focus on the energy sector because it is under increasing pressure from society due to its significant environmental footprint and social importance. As expectations regarding environmental responsibility rise, the energy sector must adapt and face challenges to ensure a long-term supply from reliable sources to meet the demands of a society that considers the social, ecological, and economic dimensions of business practices. These factors piqued our interest in the energy sector. 

Next to this we focus us on the sub-questionnaires: 
 - How did trends evolve over time in terms of topics addressed? 
 - What is the sentiment expressed in CSR reports by companies and how does it vary across continents? 
 - How have the reporting standards changed over time? 

These questions will we try to answer using the results gathered from the analyses.
